## DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE, IT IS A TEMPLATE. THAT YOU NEED TO COPY
# Prusa MK3s Klipper Config

# The first thing you'll need to do is go through this file and comment out / uncomment
# the files and/or settings you need.

# You'll be able to print just fine with this config as it is, but it is recommended
# that you follow these steps to properly calibrate your printer:

# 0) Sanity check and PID Tuning: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html
# 1) Pressure Advance: https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html
# 2) Skew Correction: https://www.klipper3d.org/skew_correction.html
# 3) Resonance Compensation: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html

# Read more about klipper here: https://www.klipper3d.org/Overview.html

### UI
[include mainsail.cfg]

[mcu]
# serial: /dev/serial0 # If you are using internal RPI serial port
serial: /dev/ttyACM0 # If you are using RPI via USB connection to printer
restart_method: command

### CONTROL BOARD
[include einsy-rambo.cfg]

### BASE SETUP
[include display.cfg]
[include steppers.cfg]
[include tmc2130.cfg]

### EXTRUSION

# Extruder
[include bmg.cfg]

# Hotend
[include mosquito.cfg]

[extruder]
# To tune Pressure Advance see https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html
# default is already set based on hotend, but you can further improve prints by calibrating it to your nozzle and material
# pressure_advance: 0.05
nozzle_diameter: 0.4 # Remember to change this if you change nozzle diameter.

## copy this from your current setting on Prusa, but make it absolute (removing -)
[probe]
z_offset = 1.400

## For faster printing enable
[printer]
max_accel: 2000
max_accel_to_decel: 2000
max_z_velocity: 20
max_z_accel: 300

## Custom bed mest probes
## Prusa has 3x3 or 7x7, you can do any variation you want
[bed_mesh]
probe_count: 5,5

# Linear correction
# Check `extruders/linear-correction` for more informations.
[include linear-correction-0.cfg] # Default Prusa linear correction optimized for LDO motors

### MACROS
[include macros.cfg]

# FIRST RUN: 
# Execute these sequentially in the console, let PID tuning finish before saving
# PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder TARGET=170
# SAVE_CONFIG
# PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=60
# SAVE_CONFIG

### The end, on the end the printer will store it's tuning data, so do not edit it.
